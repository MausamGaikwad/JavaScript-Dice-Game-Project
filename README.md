# Dice Game-Project
## Description
The Dice Project is a simple web-based dice game created by MAUSAM GAIKWAD. It allows two players to roll virtual dice, and based on the outcome, determines the winner or declares a draw.

## How to Play
1. Open the "dice project.html" file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Roll" button to initiate the dice roll for both Player 1 and Player 2.
3. The images of the rolled dice will be displayed for each player.
4. The game will declare the winner or indicate a draw based on the outcome of the dice rolls.

## Technologies Used
* HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
* CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the web page.
* JavaScript: Programming language for dynamic behavior and logic.
* Google Fonts: External fonts for enhanced typography.

## Project Structure
* index.html: The main HTML file that structures the game page.
* style.css: The CSS file containing styles for the game elements.
* index.js: The JavaScript file providing logic for rolling dice and determining the winner.
* images/: Folder containing dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png).

## How the Dice Rolling Works
1. The JavaScript code generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for both Player 1 and Player 2.
2. The random numbers are used to select corresponding dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png) from the "images" folder.
3. The selected images are displayed for each player on the web page.
4. The game compares the dice rolls, and the player with the higher number is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the game is declared a draw.
